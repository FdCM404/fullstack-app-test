# CORS - CROSS ORIGIN REQUEST SERVICE?

CORS is a mechanism that allows these requests to be made safely by 
enabling servers to specify
which origins are permitted to access their resources.


# CRUD APP - Create, Remove, Update, Delete

create: 


# ENDPOINTS

    localhost:<PORT>/create_contact


# FLASK

In Flask, the line with app.app_context(): 
is used to create a "sandbox" or a temporary environment where Flask’s features 
(like my database connection) 
are accessible even when a web request isn't actually happening.
